#Step 1
#I started with raw data in my raw data folder (../Desktop/GitHub/Laurel_genes/raw)
#These are compressed fastq files from exon capture, one for forward (R1)
#and one for reverse (R2).
#Before I do anything else, I need to unzip them using:
gunzip -k *.fastq.gz
#I don't need to merge lanes because my samples were only run once.

#Step 2
#Now I need to trim adapters.
#To use the perl script trim_adapter.pl the input files must be in .fq NOT .fastq so I need to run:
mv "$file" "$(basename "$file" .fastq).fq"
#This should give an output of .fq
#These .fq files are then put in a "demultiplexed" folder within the "data" folder.
#Before running the perl script, check the options and make sure it works by using:
trim_adaptor.pl -h
#In order for the script to work, I need several perl modules and two packages
#(trim_galore and cutadapt) to be downloaded into the @INC.
#The modules can be downloaded from the CPAN website and moved into the folder indicated in the @INC.
#The packages can be downloaded from their respective websites and put in the same folder as the modules.
#trim_galore is an easy download. cutadapt is more complicated and requires you to download via conda
#and activate a cutadapt environment before using. The @INC where everything, including the trim_adaptor.pl script, is located in /Users/laurelnave-powers/opt/miniconda3/lib/5.32.0/darwin-thread-multi-2level
#For all of this to work, you need to add this location to the $PATH by updating the ~/.zshrc file:
#In terminal:
nano ~/.zshrc 
#At the end of the file put the following two lines:
# Add to PATH
export PATH=${PATH}:/Users/laurelnave-powers/opt/miniconda3/lib/5.32.0/darwin-thread-multi-2level

#Before running the script, activate the cutadapt env using "conda activate cutadaptenv".
#Then change directories to where all the modules, script, etc. are located.
#Then run the script:
perl trim_adaptor.pl \
--raw_reads ~/Desktop/GitHub/Laurel-genes/data/demultiplexed \
--trimmed ~/Desktop/GitHub/Laurel-genes/analyses/trimmed
#The output will be in the directory "trimmed" within the "analyses" folder. It will also give report files "trimmed_reads_bases_count.txt"
#and "trimming_report/sample_name_trimming_report.txt".
#These supplemental report files can be put into a new directory "trimmed_supp" within "analyses".



#Step 3
#Now it's time to assemble.
