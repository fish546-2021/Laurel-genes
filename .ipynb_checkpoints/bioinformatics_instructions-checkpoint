#Step 1
#I started with raw data in my raw data folder (../Desktop/GitHub/Laurel_genes/raw)
#These are compressed fastq files from exon capture, one for forward (R1)
#and one for reverse (R2).
#Before I do anything else, I need to unzip them using:
gunzip -k *.fastq.gz
#I don't need to merge lanes because my samples were only run once.

#Step 2
#Now I need to trim adapters.
#To use the perl script trim_adapter.pl the input files must be in .fq NOT .fastq so I need to run:
mv "$file" "$(basename "$file" .fastq).fq"
#This should give an output of .fq
#Before running the perl script, check the options and make sure it works by using:
trim_adaptor.pl -h
#To run the script, go to your home directory and run:
trim_adaptor.pl \
--raw_reads inputfile \
--trimmed outputfile
#The output will be in the directory trimmed. It will also give report files "trimmed_reads_bases_count.txt"
#and "trimming_report/sample_name_trimming_report.txt".
#These supplemental report files can be cleaned up and put into a new directory "trimmed_supp":
mkdir 2_trimmed_supp
mv trimmed_reads_bases_count.txt 2_trimmed_supp/
mv trimming_report 2_trimmed_supp/

#Step 3
#Now it's time to assemble.
